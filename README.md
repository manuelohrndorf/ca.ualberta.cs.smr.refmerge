# RefMerge

RefMerge is a refactoring-aware merging IntelliJ plugin. RefMerge relies on RefactoringMiner to detect the refactorings and works by undoing refactorings, merging, and then replaying the refactorings. More in-depth details about the technique can be found in "A Systematic Comparison of Two Refactoring-aware Merging Techniques" (http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10370).

## Refactoring Conflict & Simplification Logic

We consider the interactions between each pair of refactorings and how these interactions can lead to a conflict or how they can result in a dependence relationship. We provide the conflict and dependence detection logic for each pair in the [conflict detection wiki](https://github.com/ualberta-smr/RefMerge/wiki/Conflict-&-Dependence-Logic). 

## System requirements
* Linux
* git
* Java 8
* IntelliJ (Community Addition) Version 2020.1.2

## (Optionally) Build RefactoringMiner

You can either build the RefactoringMiner or download it automatically as [Maven dependency](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.tsantalis/refactoring-miner). To build RefactoringMiner locally:

- Current RefactoringMiner version required for RefMerge: 2.1.0
- Requires to [install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and add it's `bin` folder to the OS's `PATH` variable.

### 1. Clone and build RefactoringMiner 
Use `Git Clone https://github.com/tsantalis/RefactoringMiner.git` to clone RefactoringMiner.
Check out the required version with `git fetch --tags` and `git checkout tags/2.0.1` (see version requirement above or in the `build.gradle` file).
Then build RefactoringMiner with `./gradlew distzip`.
It will be under build/distributions.

### 2. Add RefactoringMiner to your local maven repository
You will need to add RefactoringMiner to your local maven repository to use it in the build.gradle. 
You can use `mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file> -DgroupId=com.github.tsantalis -DartifactId=refactoring-miner -Dversion=2.1.0 -Dpackaging=zip -DgeneratePom=true`
to add it to your local maven repository. You can verify that it's been installed by checking the path `/home/username/.m2/repository/org/refactoringminer`.

## How to run

### 1. Download and install IntelliJ
From [download and install IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/download/other.html) version 2024.1 (Community Edition).

### 3. Build the project

- Requires [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/de/temurin/releases/?version=17).

Open the repository folder in the IntelliJ IDE.
Click on Gradle build tab (icon right-side) in the IntelliJ IDE.
It may take a second until the build configuration is loaded.
Then navigate to `RefMerge > Tasks > intellij` and select `buildPlugin` to build RefMerge.

### 4. Set up configuration
Then navigate to `RefMerge > Tasks > intellij` and right-click `runIde`.
From the menu select `Modify Run Configuration...`.
Edit the environment variables, set `LEFT_COMMIT=<commit id>,RIGHT_COMMIT=<commit id>` to the respective left and right commit. 
RefMerge will merge the two commits provided for a single merge scenario. This works for any merge scenario in history. 
We need to add the commits in the configuration under environment variables because RefMerge is currently designed as `AnAction` which cannot retrieve command line variables. 
This works when running the evaluation pipeline because an `ApplicationStarter` calls RefMerge supplying the commits.

### 5. Run the plugin
Then navigate to `RefMerge > Tasks > intellij` and right-click `runIde`.
From the menu select `Run...` or `Debug...` to start a second IntelliJ instance.
In debugging mode you can set break points in the source code.

When it's running, click the `Tools` tab and select `RunRefMerge`. 
This will run the plugin with the specified `LEFT_COMMIT` and `RIGHT_COMMIT=`. 
The plugin will do everything else. 
RefMerge performs the following steps: 

1. Detects refactorings on the left and right branch with RefactoringMiner.

2. Checks the detected refactorings for transitive relationships and refactoring chains and simplifies them.

3. Inverts the refactorings in the left and right parent commits.

4. Textually merges the branches with git.

5. Detects refactoring conflicts and refactoring relationships between the left and right branches.

6. Adds conflicting refactorings to a conflicting refactoring list and prints conflicting refactoring pairs.

7. Replays the non-conflicting refactorings on the textually merged code. 


## Adding new refactoring types

Adding a new refactoring type can be broken down into the following steps. 

### 1. Create refactoring object

* Create a new `RefactoringObject` class that implements `RefactoringObject` in the `src/main/java/ca/ualberta/cs/smr/refMerge/refactoringObjects`. For example, when 
adding extract method, we create `ExtractMethodObject` which implements `RefactoringObject`. The `RefactoringObject` class will store lal of the necessary information about the refactored program element, such as its signature.

* Add it to `RefactoringObjectUtils` to create it from the RefMiner object.

### 2. Determine order and transitivity logic

* Figure out which order the new refactoring type should be undone/replayed in. For example, 
when we add extract method, extract method should be undone after rename class and 
rename method.

* Add the new `RefactoringObject` class to the `RefactoringOrder` enum. The `RefactoringObject` class needs to be put in its respective position in the top-down order. For example, `Move Method` will come before `Rename Variable` and after `Move Class`.

* Add the associated logic cells. The logic cells will be the combination of the new refactoring
type and the currently covered types. When adding extract method, that gives us the extract method/
rename method, extract method/rename class, and extract method/extract method. All of the existing simplification logic can be found in the [simplification logic wiki](https://github.com/ualberta-smr/RefMerge/wiki/Simplification-Logic).

* Determine if there is transitivity or if the refactorings can be combined and add the logic. 
Extract method and rename method can have transitivity or be combined while extract method
and rename class can only be combined. 

* Add the logic to the cells and update the refactoring objects as transitivity/combinations are
found.

### 3. Determine conflict and dependence logic

* Figure out how the new refactoring type can conflict or have dependence with a refactoring on
a different branch. For example, extract method and rename method can conflict if the extracted 
method on the left branch has the same name as the renamed method on the right branch in the same
class. They can also conflict if the extracted method and renamed method have the same signature
in classes with an inheritance relationship.

* Add each logic check to the associated logic cell in `src/main/java/ca/ualberta/cs/smr/refmerge/matrix/logicCells`. For example, if we add `Rename Variable`, 
we would create `RenameVariableRenameVariableCell.java` with the conflict and dependence logic. The wiki with the currently implemented logic is located [here](https://github.com/ualberta-smr/RefMerge/wiki/Conflict-&-Dependence-Logic) 

### 4. Update logic matrix 

* Add the new refactoring type to the dispatcher and receiver hashmaps. 

* Add the new refactoring type to the vector in `Matrix.getRefactoringValue()`. Make sure to add
it as the last entry to the vector.

### 5. Programmatically revert the refactoring

* Figure out which refactoring processor to use to undo the refactoring. For extract method, it's
`InlineMethodProcessor` and rename method is `RefactoringFactory` and `RenameRefactoring`.

* Use the information in your refactoring object to get the PSI elements necessary to perform
the refactoring.

### 6. Programmatically replay the refactoring

* In most cases the refactoring process to replay the refactoring will be the same. For extract
method, undoing the refactoring uses `InlineMethodProcessor` and replaying uses `ExtractMethodProcessor`.

* Use the information in your refactoring object to get the PSI elements necessary to perform
the refactoring.
